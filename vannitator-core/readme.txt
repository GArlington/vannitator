0.2-beta-1

Basic - very raw - version working. 

TODO before release.
 >> - make the onetoone,manytoone OR manytoone,onetoone processing order work. (support how Eclipse will execute us)
 - remove the enum for the types (do we REALLY need that ? Can't we just use the class names of the Annotations)
 - Make the Name handlers better so that we don't have to serialize them
